You can use our services in different ways - to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. As you use our services, we want you to be aware how we use your information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.'|lang }}
{{ 'By using our website, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, we encourage you to read this Privacy Policy carefully when using our services or transacting business with us.'|lang }}

{{ 'Local storage'|lang }}
{{ 'We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.'|lang }}

{{ 'We may use the name you provide for your Tourist Tube Profile across all of the services we offer that require a Tourist Tube Account. In addition, we may replace past names associated with your Tourist Tube Account so that you are represented consistently across all our services.

{{ 'Direct mail partners: From time to time we may share our postal mailing list with selected providers of goods and services that you may be interested in. If you prefer not to receive mailings from these providers, you can notify us at any time.'|lang }}
{{ 'Other Situations: We also may disclose your information:'|lang }}
{{ 'In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.'|lang }}
{{ 'When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, report or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.'|lang }}
{{ 'In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.'|lang }}
{{ 'Any third parties to whom we may disclose personal information may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about their privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties.'|lang }}
{{ 'We may also share aggregated and non-personal information we collect under any of the above circumstances with third parties companies to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.'|lang }}
{{ '(iv) Your choices on accessing and updating personal information'|lang }}
{{ 'Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content.'|lang }}
{{ 'People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. For example, you can:'|lang }}

{{ 'Use our editor to see and adjust how your Tourist Tube Profile appears to particular individuals.'|lang }}
{{ 'Control who you share information with.'|lang }}
{{ 'Take information out of many of our services.'|lang }}
{{ 'Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information.

When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.'|lang }}
{{ 'Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Hence, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.'|lang }}

{{ 'Enforcement'|lang }}
{{ 'We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy and we also adhere to several self-regulatory frameworks. Furthermore, when we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the complaining person to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that we cannot resolve with our users directly.'|lang }}
{{ 'Changes'|lang }}
{{ 'Our Privacy Policy may change be subject to changes. Albeit, we will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. Any upcoming privacy policy changes will be posted on the current page. If the changes are significant, we will be providing a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). All the prior versions of this Privacy Policy will be kept for your review.'|lang }}
